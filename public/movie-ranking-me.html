<h1>The Best Movies According to Chiara</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>KÃ¶nige der Wellen</h3>
<p>Best childhood movie. Watched it a thousand times with my best friends. I really like the humor of this movie, especially in the interviews. </p>

<h3>Fluch der Karibik</h3>
<p>Also one of my favourite childhood movies. No one is as funny as Jack Sparrow. I only need to hear the movie soundtrack and I instantly see him running over the bridge or making a funny face. </p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Such a great story. <br />
    It fascinates me how all the little details of the story fit perfectly together in the end. </p>
